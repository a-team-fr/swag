## Project big picture
* **v0.0.1** : good enough to play with to create simple documents and program your own QML stuff. Swag will likely show a poor UI, a number of bugs and a limited feature set. Also the document format is likely to change. Yet, this version should help understanding the project potential. This milestone should be reached somewhere in April 2020.
* **v0.1.0** : good enough to create presentation. First official version using a somewhat standardized document format. Swag contains all classic presentation features together with advanced features. Swag might be used to experiment others application (dynamic report, book, training support...). This milestone should be reached somewhere around April 2021.
* **v1.0.0** : good enough to create any kind of application. Swag is a mature solution to handle a number of uses cases, backed with a generous toolbox it can be used to generate easily anykind of application. This milestone might be reached somewhere around April 2030.
