\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysubsection{Purpose}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md28}
The aim of this project is to provide a tool to easily create simple application with building blocks made in Q\+ML. ~\newline
 As s🤘ag is basically loading and interpreting Q\+ML documents, there is no reason why s🤘ag would be limited to a presentation system \+: it could be possible to use it to create any kind of application.

There are already a number of similar projects, why create yet another one ? ~\newline
 Well... \+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item because it is {\itshape {\bfseries{fun}}} ! s🤘ag is the kind of project that covers lots of domain.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item because it is {\bfseries{free}} ! Most of the existing mature solution I know are based on a user locking in \+: either because of closed license or because of SaaS mode. That\textquotesingle{}s the reason why s🤘ag is G\+PL, to ensure users will always be free to use, study, modify or redistribute it !
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item because {\bfseries{Low Tech}} matters (at least to me) ! One more and more consume SaaS service for everything and whilst these demanding huge datacenter are producing lots of C\+O2. I am convinced that this model is not sustainable and that we should and we will move from SaaS. s🤘ag is thus an autonomous desktop solution, some very cool feature will be relying on network communication but they will remain optional and limited.

For years, I was enthusiastic of speakers using their own presentation system. As the community manager of the Nantes Qt Meetup, I had considered a number of times to use one the existing Qt based presentation projects (such as the excellent \href{https://github.com/qt-labs/qml-presentation-system}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/qt-\/labs/qml-\/presentation-\/system}} ). ~\newline
 Quite recently during the 2020 F\+O\+S\+D\+EM last February, I have seen a stunning talk of Christophe de Dinechin made with a custom presentation system (T\+AO with XL langage), and this time it really convinced me that my next presentations should be made with such a system. My first need was very simple \+: design a training material that could show Q\+ML code and render it dynamically. ~\newline
 Following the confinement call in March, as my business stalled whilst having to stay at home I had plenty of time to design a very simple version... ~\newline
 Starting working on the project strengthen my initial feelings that such a tool is quite fun to design, very useful for creating rocking presentation and could be used for a lot more of use cases !\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsection{why Swag as name ?}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md30}
In french somethin \char`\"{}swag\char`\"{} is something cool, and i think s🤘ag is very cool ! I also liked the \char`\"{}\+Sophisticated Wild Ass Guess\char`\"{} as something that quickly do the job. ~\newline


One can also think of fun abbreviation such as \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Serendipity Without A Glitch
\item Software With Awesome Generator
\item Some Would Argue Genius
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{How it works ?}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md31}
 From the welcome page, one can either create a new s🤘ag or open and existing one. ~\newline
 A s🤘ag is currently handled as directory so you will need to select the parent folder of the s🤘ag content ( this might change in a near future).

 When a s🤘ag is opened, it is possible to create a new slide or clone an existing one from the drawer menu. ~\newline


Enter in \char`\"{}\+Edit mode\char`\"{} (with Ctrl+D or from the edit menu) to show the toolbox (at the screen right side) with the list of Element you can integrate into your slide \+: a Text, an Image, a chart etc...



While \char`\"{}\+Edit mode\char`\"{} is active, hover an element to display its bounding box with editing functions (repositioning, changing properties or deleting the element).

At anytime, it is possible to trigger the \char`\"{}\+Show code\char`\"{} mode to inspect the current slide Q\+ML code, edit and reload the slide to see the changes without restarting s🤘ag.



From the Deck settings, it is possible to choose the display mode between \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Loader \+: only one slide is rendered at a time
\item List\+View \+: to swipe from one slide to another
\item Flat\+View \+: to navigate from one element or slide to another in a similar manner than Prezi.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysubsubsection{Toolbox}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md32}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a Text element (currently only a limited set of a text properties are supported)
\item a Code element \+: to show code with syntax highlighting (relying on highlight.\+js) together with a rendered object from Q\+ML code
\item Goto\+Button \+: a button to change the current slide
\item Webview
\item Image
\item Map
\item Multiple Choice Question \+: each choice is made of an image and/or a text. When the M\+CQ is validated, each choice can be flipped to show an image and/or a text.
\item Chart
\item Dataviz
\item Video or camera
\item Entity 3D \+: show a 3D mesh
\item P\+DF \+: a pdf reader based on pdf.\+js One can find an example of using these elements with the \char`\"{}\+Gallery\char`\"{} s🤘ag.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md33}
It is strongly advised to use the latest stable Qt version (Qt5.\+14.\+1 at the time of the project start).


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item git clone the project and get its submodules 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/a-\/team-\/fr/swag.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{git submodule update -\/-\/init}
\end{DoxyCode}

\item Open the project with Qt\+Creator
\item Build \& run
